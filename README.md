 ## Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning
This repository contains the code and documentation for a research project focused on detecting credit card fraud using advanced machine learning models.
The project was developed during a research internship at IIIT Dharwad under the mentorship of Dr. Abdul Wahid.

### Key Features
Models Developed: Two machine learning models (Logistic Regression and Random Forest) optimized for fraud detection, both achieving over 99% accuracy.
Techniques Used: Data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
Metrics: Accuracy, RÂ² Score, and Mean Squared Error (MSE) used to evaluate model performance.
### Repository Contents
Code: Python scripts for data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.
Documentation: Detailed explanations of the methods used and the results obtained.
Datasets: Sample datasets used for training and testing the models.
### How to Use
Clone the repository and run the scripts in a Python environment to replicate the results or use the models on your own data.
